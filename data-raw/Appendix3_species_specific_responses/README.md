spp_found_vs_missing.R looks at how often species were detected when they were seeded and generates figures that are used in Appendix 3. 

detection_rates_and_pi.R was an exploration of whether the amount of the seed mix devoted to a species impacts it's relative cover, but this is currently not being used in Lydia's thesis.
