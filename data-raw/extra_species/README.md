"Extra species" are those species that are occur at sites, but were not detected in the vegetation survey. 

There is a list of extra species for each survey year. Unfortunately one year is formatted long and the other is formatted wide....

"make_extra_spp_dataset.R" is a script that then translates the csv files into a .rda
